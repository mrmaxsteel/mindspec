# Workflow Domain — Interfaces

## Provided Interfaces

### Phase Derivation (ADR-0023)

```go
package phase

// DiscoverActiveSpecs queries beads for all open epics and derives phase for each.
func DiscoverActiveSpecs() ([]ActiveSpec, error)

// FindEpicBySpecID finds the epic ID for a given spec ID by querying metadata.
func FindEpicBySpecID(specID string) (string, error)

// DerivePhase determines the lifecycle phase from an epic's children statuses.
func DerivePhase(epicID string) (string, error)

// ResolveContext determines the current spec, bead, phase from working directory.
func ResolveContext(root string) (*Context, error)
```

### Target Resolution (Spec 079)

```go
package resolve

// ResolveTarget determines which spec to operate on via --spec flag, CWD, or auto-select.
func ResolveTarget(root, specFlag string) (string, error)

// ResolveSpecPrefix resolves a numeric prefix (e.g. "079") to a full spec ID.
func ResolveSpecPrefix(prefix string) (string, error)
```

### Guidance Emission (Spec 004)

```go
package instruct

// BuildContext creates a rendering context from state and project root.
func BuildContext(root string) *Context

// Render produces markdown guidance for the given context.
func Render(ctx *Context) (string, error)
```

### Beads Adapter (`internal/bead/`)

```go
package bead

func RunBD(args ...string) ([]byte, error)   // Execute bd commands
func ListJSON(args ...string) ([]byte, error) // List with JSON output
func Close(ids ...string) error               // Close beads
func WorktreeList() ([]WorktreeListEntry, error)
```

## Consumed Interfaces

- **core**: `workspace.FindRoot()`, `workspace.DetectWorktreeContext()` for locating state and worktrees
- **execution**: `executor.Executor` for all git/worktree operations
- **context-system**: `contextpack.RenderBeadContext()` for bead primers

## CLI Commands

| `mindspec cleanup` | Remove stale worktrees and branches |
| `mindspec config show` | Print the effective config (panel/models/loop/runner + pre-existing keys), read-only (spec 109 R9) |

## Agent Skills

## Maintenance Notes

- **2026-07-07 (spec 109 Bead 4, orchestration config substrate — R8/R9):**
  `cmd/mindspec/config.go` adds a read-only `config` command with a `show`
  subcommand: it loads the effective config via `config.Load`, renders it
  through the pure `renderConfig(*config.Config) (string, error)` (no fs, no
  panel scan — testable without a process), and prints it to stdout. The
  `models:`, `loop:`, and `runner:` blocks are annotated "declared, not yet
  enforced" in the rendered output; `panel:` is not, since it already drives
  a fresh panel.json's creation-time defaults today. `renderConfig` sorts
  `Loop.GateAuthority`'s map keys before rendering (a map iterated directly
  would make the command's output nondeterministic) and renders
  `PanelApproveThresholdExpr()` verbatim (no trim/normalize — the resolver's
  contract is "exactly as configured").
  Two caller-side surfaces render the leaf-safe `panel.ReviewerCountNote`
  advisory (Bead 3) when a registered panel's recorded `expected_reviewers`
  differs from `cfg.PanelExpectedReviewers()` — never altering any gate
  `Allow`/`Block`: (1) `config show`'s command handler
  (`reviewerCountNotesFor` in `cmd/mindspec/config.go`) scans every
  registered panel across the repo root and every spec's own directory
  (`configShowReviewRoots`, since `config show` has no bead/spec context
  to scope the scan the way the complete-gate does) and appends one note
  line per differing panel; (2) `internal/complete`'s authoritative panel
  gate (`panelGate`, `panel_advisory.go`) — reached from `complete.Run`
  step 2.25, AFTER the gate's own Allow/Block decision — prints the same
  note via the new `reviewerCountAdvisory` helper to the advisory writer
  when the matched panel's recorded count differs from the config default.
- **2026-07-02 (spec 107 wave 1):** `mindspec complete`'s children/epic bd
  fan-out was collapsed. The post-close state advance (`internal/complete`
  `advanceState`) now reads children through the new exported
  `phase.FetchChildren(epicID)` seam — a single uncached `bd list --parent`
  query — replacing the old per-status `queryAllChildren` loop (~5 subprocesses).
  `complete.Run` also resolves the immutable spec→epic mapping ONCE through a
  shared `phase.Cache` (threaded via `phase.EnsureMigratedWithCache` /
  `phase.FindEpicBySpecIDWithCache` / `phase.DerivePhaseWithCache`), so a run
  issues at most one `bd list --type=epic` while the post-close children read
  stays fresh. Gate-failure error/`recovery:` lines are unchanged (ADR-0035).
- **2026-07-02 (spec 108 wave 2, bead wpjv.3):** `internal/validate` grew two
  per-run caching seams that cut redundant reads without changing a single
  emitted diagnostic (ADR-0036/ADR-0032 contracts intact). (1) An in-memory
  `ownershipCache` (keyed by domain, routed through the `loadOwnershipForRefFn`
  seam) loads each candidate domain's `OWNERSHIP.yaml` at most once per
  `ValidateDivergence`, `checkInternalPackages`, and `normalizeImpactedDomains`
  run — replacing the old per-`(file × domain)` `attributeDomain` re-load, and
  with it the up-to-three `git show` subprocesses per domain in
  `LoadOwnershipAtRef`. `attributeDomain` is now a one-shot wrapper over the
  shared-cache `attributeDomainCached`. (2) A `memoStore` decorator (validate-
  local, `internal/adr` untouched) wraps the store from the `adrStoreForSpecFn`
  seam so `coverageOf` / `hasAcceptedCitation` / `checkADRCitations` read each
  distinct cited ADR from disk at most once per run instead of
  `O(domains × citations)` times. Both seams are countable, and a golden
  diagnostics fixture pins byte-identical `(code, message)` output pre/post
  caching.
