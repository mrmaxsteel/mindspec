## Goal

Enable A/B comparison of MindSpec-assisted vs freestyle Claude Code sessions. Capture token cost, cycle time, and per-phase breakdown so operators can quantify MindSpec's impact on development efficiency.

## Impacted Domains

- **cli**
- **contextpack**
- **instruct**
- **glossary**

## Applicable Policies

| ID | Severity | Description | Reference |
|:---|:---------|:------------|:----------|
| spec-mode-no-code | error | In Spec Mode, only markdown files may be created or modified. Code changes are forbidden until the spec is approved. | docs/core/MODES.md#spec-mode |
| spec-required | error | Every functional change must refer to a spec in docs/specs/ | — |
| doc-sync-required | warning | Changes to core logic must be accompanied by updates to docs/core/, docs/domains/, or docs/features/. Done includes doc-sync. | — |
| adr-divergence-gate | error | If implementation or planning detects that an accepted ADR blocks progress or is unfit, the agent must stop, inform the user, and present divergence options. A new superseding ADR requires human approval. | docs/core/MODES.md#implementation-mode |
| plan-must-cite-adrs | warning | Plans and implementation beads must cite the ADRs they rely on. Uncited ADR reliance is a policy violation. | docs/core/ARCHITECTURE.md#adr-lifecycle |
| domain-operations-require-approval | error | Adding, splitting, or merging domains requires explicit human approval and must produce an ADR. | docs/core/ARCHITECTURE.md#domains |
| spec-declares-impacted-domains | warning | Every spec must declare its impacted domains and relevant ADR touchpoints. | docs/core/MODES.md#spec-mode |
| beads-concise-entries | warning | Beads entries must remain concise and execution-oriented. Long-form specs, ADRs, and domain docs live in the documentation system, not in Beads. | docs/adr/ADR-0002.md |
| beads-active-workset | warning | Keep only active and near-term issues open in Beads. Regularly clean up completed work. Rely on git history + docs for archival traceability. | docs/adr/ADR-0002.md |
| clean-tree-before-transition | error | Working tree must be clean (no uncommitted changes) before starting new work, picking up a bead, or switching modes. If dirty: commit or revert. Never auto-stash. | docs/core/CONVENTIONS.md#clean-tree-rule |
| milestone-commit-at-transition | error | Mode transitions must produce a milestone commit: spec(<bead-id>) for Spec→Plan, plan(<bead-id>) for Plan→Implement, impl(<bead-id>) for Implement→Done. .beads/ changes must be co-committed. | docs/core/CONVENTIONS.md#milestone-commits |
