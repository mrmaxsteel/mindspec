# CLAUDE.md — MindSpec
<!-- BEGIN mindspec:managed -->

**IMPORTANT**: You MUST read and follow [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) as your primary behavioral instructions. AGENTS.md is the canonical source of project conventions, workflow rules, and development guidance shared across all coding agents.

Run `mindspec instruct` for mode-appropriate operating guidance. This is emitted automatically by the SessionStart hook.
